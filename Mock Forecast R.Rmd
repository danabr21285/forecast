This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Set working directory
setwd("your_working_directory")

# Load dataset
XYZdf <- read.csv("yearly_activity_data.csv")

# Plot the time series
ggplot(data = XYZdf, aes(x = Year, y = Purchases)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Purchases by Year (2020â€“2024)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Purchases")

# Add a numeric time variable
XYZdf$Time <- 1:nrow(XYZdf)

# Fit a linear regression model
model <- lm(Purchases ~ Time, data = XYZdf)
summary(model)

# Forecast purchases for 2025 (Time = 6)
new_time <- data.frame(Time = 6)
predict(model, newdata = new_time)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
